This was my final project for my Masterâ€™s degree. I analysed labour market data from the 
Office for National Statistics (ONS) and combined econometric models with machine learning techniques to build 
hybrid forecasting models. The goal was to evaluate whether these hybrid models could provide stronger predictive 
performance compared to standalone approaches.
