This was a group project completed with five other team members. After initially exploring the German power grid, we 
decided to focus on the Chilean power grid. The main objective was to analyse the network’s structure by examining 
its edges (connections) and nodes (representing key components within the power grid). This project was particularly 
interesting given Chile’s exposure to natural disasters, which made identifying critical nodes especially meaningful.
