This was a statistics project completed in RStudio focused on species richness. I applied a range of 
statistical techniques, including correlation analysis, boxplots, contingency tables, hypothesis testing, and 
linear regression. Additionally, I conducted an open analysis to examine species richness across different land 
classifications, such as rounded mountains and upper valleys.
